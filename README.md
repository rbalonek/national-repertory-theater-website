# National Repertory Theater

The National Repertory Theater was created to provide performance opportunities for local artists while bringing communities together through music and the arts.

Our goal is to pay performers livable wages while utilizing the amazing talent we have throughout the United States of America. We accomplish these goals with children's outreach, fully staged productions, and community outreach.

We team up with local vendors to help promote small business and local engagement while supporting local talent, nationwide.
